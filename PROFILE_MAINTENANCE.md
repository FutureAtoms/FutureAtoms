# GitHub Profile Maintenance System

This is an automated system designed to keep your GitHub profile updated with the latest statistics, achievements, and activities. This document explains how the system works and how to maintain it.

## System Components

### 1. Profile README.md
The main profile file displayed on your GitHub profile page. It contains dynamic sections that are automatically updated by GitHub Actions.

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows
- **profile-updater.yml**: The main workflow that updates various sections of your README
- **snake.yml**: Creates the snake animation for your contribution graph

### 3. Python Scripts
- **update_stats.py**: Fetches your GitHub statistics and updates the README

## How It Works

1. The system runs automatically once a day via GitHub Actions
2. It collects your latest GitHub stats, achievements, activities
3. It updates the dynamic sections in your README.md
4. It generates a snake animation of your contribution graph
5. It adds your latest blog posts if configured

## Setting Up

1. Make sure your README.md repository is named exactly the same as your GitHub username
2. Place all the files in this system into that repository
3. Configure the GitHub Actions workflows by updating:
   - Your GitHub username in the Python script
   - Your blog RSS feeds if you want to display recent posts

## Required Secrets

The workflows require a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret, which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions. No additional setup is required for this.

## Customizing Your Profile

### Adding Technologies
Edit the "Technologies & Tools" section in README.md to reflect your skills.

### Updating Personal Information
Replace the placeholder text in the "About Me" section with your own information.

### Adding Blog Posts
To display your recent blog posts, update the blog-post-workflow in the profile-updater.yml with your RSS feed URLs.

## Manually Triggering Updates

You can manually trigger the workflow by:

1. Going to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Selecting the "Profile Readme Updater" workflow
3. Clicking "Run workflow"

## Troubleshooting

If the workflows aren't running correctly:

1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Verify that your repository has the correct name (it must match your username)
3. Ensure all files are in the correct locations
4. Check that your README.md contains the correct comment tags for the dynamic sections

## Extending the System

You can extend this system by:

1. Adding more dynamic sections to your README.md
2. Creating additional Python scripts to fetch data from other sources
3. Modifying the GitHub Actions workflows to include more update tasks

## Maintenance Schedule

- Daily: Automatic updates via GitHub Actions
- Monthly: Review and update your "About Me" section manually
- Quarterly: Update your skill sets and technologies if you've learned new ones
